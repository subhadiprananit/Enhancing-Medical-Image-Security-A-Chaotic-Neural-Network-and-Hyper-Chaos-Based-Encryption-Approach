# Chaotic System-Based Neural Network for Image Transformation

This project implements a simple neural-network-like structure where the weights and biases are generated using a chaotic system (a 4D nonlinear dynamic system).  
The network processes a grayscale image and generates a transformed image as output.


##  Features
- Custom chaotic system to generate pseudo-random weights and biases.
- Simple feedforward network with one hidden layer (ReLU activation).
- Transformation of grayscale image input into a new grayscale image output.
- 3D plot of the chaotic attractor trajectory for visualization.
